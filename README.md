# React Native Image Search

## Installation ##

1. Clone this repo by running ```git clone https://github.com/niaz151/react-native-img-search.git``` within your terminal 

2. Navigate to the project directory by running ```cd react-native-img-search``` and run ```yarn install``` ( if yarn is needed as a prerequisite install yarn )

3. Run the ```yarn start``` command while still in the project directory

4. Install Expo on your mobile device via App Store or Play Store

5. Use your mobile device camera to scan the QR code that pops up in your browser or terminal which in turn should open the Expo app with a running copy of the application

## Features ##

- Many uses of React Hooks, allowing for a much cleaner codebase , and codeblocks separated by logic instead of lifecycle

- Searchbar results appear in real-time as the user types

- Image data in stored in such a way that displaying further data such as number of likes or number of downloads is easily configurable

## Notes ##

- I would have used Snack.io to host this sample, however, the 'react-native-elements' package is not compatible with package versions on Snack.io

- It is best practice to hide the API_KEY in an .env file but for the purposes of this project and its functionality I decided not to do so
